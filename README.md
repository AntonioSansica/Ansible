# Ansible Roles Collection

This repository contains a collection of Ansible roles based on my daily activities. Each role is designed to automate specific tasks and configurations, making it easier to manage and deploy consistent environments.

## Overview

Ansible roles are a way to group multiple tasks together into a single unit of work. They provide a structured way of organizing playbooks and can be reused across different projects. This collection includes roles for various common tasks that I encounter regularly in my work.
